graphs:

Ok, it's probably easier to go ahead and write my own graph library
than to try to use something off the shelf, like cl-graph.

But, this means I've some decisions to make. How do we represent
ndoes, edges, etc???

Let's have a protocol class of graph that implementation classes can
subclass. The obvious represenation for edges are an edge list, an
adjaceny list, and an adjacency matrix. Each implementation has
strengths and weaknesses, which we won't get into here.

For the moment, let's implement the edge-list-graph first and leave
the other graphs for later. Molecules aren't likely to be densely
connected, so the edge-list graph should be fine forthe moment.

What about edges?

Do we support both directed and undirected edges? Should this be per
graph or per edge?

Do we support self-edges?

Do we support multiple edges between the same nodes?

graph algorithms:

* breadth-first search
* depth-first search

For the search algorithms we probably want multiple flavors, including
one that returns the path found by search algorithm and one that calls
a function for each searched node.

TODO:

1. add-edge (and friends) -> add-edge-between-nodes
2. add-edge (and friends) that take an edge instead of 2 nodes
